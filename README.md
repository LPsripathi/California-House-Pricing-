# 🏠 Linear Regression on California Housing Dataset

## 📌 Description

This project applies **Linear Regression** to the **California Housing dataset** to predict median house values based on various socio-economic features. The goal is to understand how well a simple linear model can explain the variation in housing prices.

---

## 🧠 Objective

- Predict median house value using multiple independent variables.
- Understand model performance through **R² Score** and **RMSE**.
- Visualize key aspects like residuals, prediction accuracy, and feature importance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

- **R² Score:** ~0.576
- **RMSE:** ~0.746

The model explains about **57.6% of the variance** in housing prices.
